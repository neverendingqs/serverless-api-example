    # Alternative data stores:

    # - S3 (+ CloudFront?)
    #   - Pro: Storage is ~4.35x less expensive than S3
    #   - Con: S3 read / write latency is not as low as DDB
    #   - Con: S3 read / write cost is higher (~4x for writes, ~1.74x for reads)
    #   - Maybe if user reads / writes are low?
    #     - Could use DDB Standard-IA instead of Standard?

    # - Aurora (Serverless?)
    #   - Pro: Storage cost is lower
    #     - This could mean SARGability is higher due to lower index costs
    #   - Pro: Can store and JOIN across multiple domains beyond users
    #   - Con: Upfront schema definitions
    #   - Con: Ongoing schema management (e.g. adding a column)
    #   - Con: May need to add, configure, and manage VPCs and DB credentials (vs. pure IAM)


    # TODO: CloudWatch alarms for API Lambda function:

    # - Duration thresholds
    #   - Cold start time might be interesting later on
